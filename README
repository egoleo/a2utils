Apache 2 Utils
==============

This is intended to be a collection of utilities for working with the apache2
web server.

Currently there is only a single script available, a2mksite. It is raw, 
assumes that you are on Debian and that you want your virtual hosts set up
exactly the way I do. That is because I wrote the script to speed up my own
work first and foremost, but I would love to see the script one day work on
other distros/operating systems as well and to be have more options.
